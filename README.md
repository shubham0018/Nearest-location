# Nearest-location
It gives the closest location for the given input location.

Need to install 3 packages -
1. 'GoogleMaps' - for using requests
2. 'geopy' - used for calculating distance b/w 2 locations
3. 'gmplot' - for plotting locations in GoogleMap and saving as map.html

O/p- The output gives the location which is nearest to the input location and prints the distance between them in meters with precision of 2.
And map.html file is created which contains all the given location(marked) and the input location and a line joining the input location to its nearest location from given input.
